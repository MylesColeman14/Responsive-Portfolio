Myles began programming at the age to 12 with the help of his toutor, Miles, he learned actionscript, python and c++ over the next two years. In highschool Myles founded Roycemore's first programming club which he had to force his freinds to attend so it would stay active. He graduated Roycemore and attended the Ira A Fulton School of Engineering at Arizona State University where he is currently studing computer science. During his summers Myles works at ID Tech camps teaching young children how to program. Myles first became intrested in computers from watching Star Trek the Next Generation, his favorite character, Data, is an AI a concept that still interests him to this day. Myles is also pretty bad at writing luckly he is good at math which makes up for his lack of ability to find and correct grammar, spelling, and syntax errors.
